# Fast food queue
First Java project from studies.  
It's FIFO Queue for fastfood restaurant, made to be used in terminal.  
  
It had to be done with JDBC driver, without maven as dependency maganer. 

<hr>

## Catalog structure
-> src - all classes used in this project
-> library - JDBC jar dependency
-> Database/* - database export

<hr>

## Funcionality 
* Creating and logging in as certain user
* CRUD in FIFO Queue
* Connecting to database 

<hr>

## What I've learned:
* how to use mysql database driver
* basic OOP concepts: what are classes, abstract classes, enums, etc.
* basic operations with GitHub
* always use dependency manager.
* applications with user interface are mid in terminal.
